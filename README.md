# Design Teardown

In this simple project, we’ll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine with which you’re probably familiar by now – Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise is to start training to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

Our job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy.
